		# the dot product of AP and AB divided by the square of the length

		# find I:
		#
		#   Ix = Ax + r(Bx-Ax)
		#   Iy = Ay + r(By-Ay)
		#
		# And the distance from A to I = r*L.
		# Use another parameter s to indicate the location along IP, with the 
		# following meaning:
		#    s<0      P is left of AB
		#    s>0      P is right of AB
		#    s=0      P is on AB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module encodes a list of lat/lon points representing a polyline into a
format for use with Google Maps.  This format is described here:

L<http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/polylinealgorithm.html>

The module is a port of Mark McClure's C<PolylineEncoder.js> with some minor
tweaks.  The original can be found here:

L<http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/>

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR & ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item new( [%args] )

Create a new encoder.  Arguments are optional and correspond to the accessor
with the same name: L</num_levels>, L</zoom_factor>, L</visible_threshold>,
L</force_endpoints>.

Note: there's nothing stopping you from setting these properties each time you
L</encode> a polyline.

=item num_levels

How many different levels of magnification the polyline has.
Default: 18.

=item zoom_factor

The change in magnification between those levels (see L</num_levels>).
Default: 2.

=item visible_threshold

Indicates the length of a barely visible object at the highest zoom level.
Default: 0.00001.  err.. units.

=item force_endpoints

Indicates whether or not the endpoints should be visible at all zoom levels.
force_endpoints is.  Probably should stay true regardless.
Default: 1=true.

=item escape_encoded_points

Indicates whether or not the encoded points should have escape characters
escaped, eg:

  $points =~ s/\\/\\\\/g;

This is useful if you'll be evalling the resulting strings, or copying them into
a static document.

B<Warning:> don't turn this on if you'll be passing the encoded points straight
on to your application, or you'll get unexpected results (ie: lines that start
out right, but end up horribly wrong).  It may even crash your browser.

Default: 0=false.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item encode( \@points );

Encode the points into a string for use with Google Maps C<GPolyline.fromEncoded>
using a variant of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm and the Polyline encoding
algorithm defined by Google.

Expects a reference to a C<@points> array ala:

  [
   { lat => 38.5, lon => -120.2 },
   { lat => 40.7, lon => -120.95 },
   { lat => 43.252, lon => -126.453 },
  ];

Returns a hashref containing:

  {
   points => 'encoded points string',
   levels => 'encoded levels string',
   num_levels => int($num_levels),
   zoom_factor => int($zoom_factor),
  };

You can then use the L<JSON> modules (or XML, or whatever) to pass the encoded
values to your Javascript application for use there.

=head1 TODO

Benchmarking, & maybe bring distance calcs in-line as Joel Rosenberg did:
L<http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/gmap_polyline_encoder.rb.txt>

As Lee Goddard suggests, accept points as arrays in inputs to encode(), eg:

 my $points = [ [$lat1, $lon1], ... ]; # like this
 my $points = [ $lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2 ]; # or this
